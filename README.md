## üöÄ How to run the project

To run the project you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) and [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your machine. You will also need a text editor, I used [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).

- Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/mvnulman/crud-troupe.git

```

# Client (Front-End)

1. Access the project folder.

```
 cd .\crud-troupe\
```

2. Install dependencies.

```
yarn 
```
or
```
npm install
```

3. Run the application in development mode.

```
yarn start
```
or

```
npm start
```

4. Access the Local Host
```
https://localhost:3000
```
<br>


# Server (Back-End)

1. Access the /src project folder.

```
 cd .\crud-troupe\src
```

2. Install the JSON-Server globally in your machine
```
yarn global add json-server
```
or
```
npm install -g json-server
```

3. Run the server, using this command:
```
json-server --watch db.json --delay 2000 --port 8000

* The port 5000 was changed due conflicts with the Control Center service on macOS Monterey using this port.
```
